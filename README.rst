Brightway2 input and output
===========================

This package provides tools for the management of inventory databases and impact assessment methods. It is part of the `Brightway2 LCA framework <http://brightwaylca.org>`_. `Online documentation <https://brightway2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ is available, and the source code is hosted on `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/cmutel/brightway2-data>`_.

Current status:
* Export: All working, copied over from bw2data
* Import ecospold1: Working, but needs allocation strategy
* Import ecospold2: Working, but needs work on ghost exchanges strategy (where exchange input dataset does not exist)
* Import SimaPro CSV: Working, link to ecoinvent 3 working (but not perfect across system models). No linking to ecoinvent 2.

SimaPro questions:
* SimaPro 8 and new ecoinvent biosphere flow names?
