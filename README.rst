* Import ecospold1 multioutput: Working, but needs cleaning for 'code' field
* Import ecospold1 LCIA: Working
* Import ecospold2: Working
* Import SimaPro CSV: Working, link to ecoinvent 3 working (but not perfect across system models). No linking to ecoinvent 2 as background.

SimaPro questions:
* SimaPro 8 and new ecoinvent biosphere flow names?
